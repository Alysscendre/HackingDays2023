Scaleway CLI Autocompletion

If Scaleway CLI autocompletion is not already loaded, the code automatically loads the autocompletion script for the scw command. This enables autocompletion for all Scaleway CLI commands.

Make sure to have the Scaleway CLI installed and initialized before using the autocompletion feature.
